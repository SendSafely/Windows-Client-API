# .NET Client API
The SendSafely .NET Client API allows programmatic access to SendSafely for sending and receiving files. For additional documentation, refer to our [Client API Overview documentation](https://sendsafely.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042043752-Client-API-Overview).

Refer to the SendSafely [Windows-Client-API/SampleApplication](https://github.com/SendSafely/Windows-Client-API/tree/master/SampleConsoleApplication) for a quick start with using the .NET Client API. When building the project, make sure the dependencies include the latest SendSafely API DLL from the [Releases Page] (https://github.com/SendSafely/Windows-Client-API/releases).

The SendSafely API uses the [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) which is supported by Visual Studio version 17.8 and greater.
